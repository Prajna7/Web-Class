		<h2>Curse of the Golden Flower</h2>
		<p>My Favorite Movie is Curse of the Golden Flower. Curse of the Golden Flower is a 2006 Chinese epic wuxia drama film written and directed by Zhang Yimou. The Mandarin Chinese title of the movie is taken from the last line of Qi Dynasty poem written by the rebel leader Emperor Huang Chao who was also the Emperor of the Qi Dynasty that was at war against the Later Tang Dynasty.
